# Dataset: politiquices (development version)

Support and opposition relations extracted from news articles archived in Arquivo.pt. The dataset describes news articles in Portuguese and the presented political stances. [Dataset source](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/6130e331078190fd0c6c3819?locale=en), [more information about the project (Portuguese)](https://www.politiquices.pt/about).

*This README is a snapshot of documentation for the latest development version of the dataset.
Full documentation for all versions can be found [on the website](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/politiquices/dev).*

    - **Type**: <abbr title="Class for instances of using an RDF stream type, in a program, an academic paper, or elsewhere. This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.
